        "### Introduction to LLM Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Dataset Preparation\n",
        "   - **Multiple-Choice Format**: Create a dataset where each question has a set of possible answers (usually labeled as A, B, C, D, etc.).\n",
        "   - **Correct Answer Annotation**: Ensure each question has the correct answer clearly marked.\n",
        "   - Example format:\n",
        "     ```json\n",
        "     {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n",
        "       \"choices\": [\"A. Paris\", \"B. London\", \"C. Rome\", \"D. Madrid\"],\n",
        "       \"correct_answer\": \"A\"\n",
        "     }\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Prompting the Model\n",
        "   - You can prompt the LLM to select the correct answer by presenting the question and the available choices. Structure the input in a way that the LLM understands it is a multiple-choice task.\n",
        "   - Example prompt for GPT-style models:\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     Question: What is the capital of France?\n",
        "     A) Paris\n",
        "     B) London\n",
        "     C) Rome\n",
        "     D) Madrid\n",
        "     Choose the correct answer:\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Model Inference\n",
        "   - Run the model on each question. Depending on the design of the LLM, you can:\n",
        "     - **Direct Answer Selection**: The model directly outputs one of the choices (e.g., \"A\" for Paris).\n",
        "     - **Text Completion**: The model completes the sentence with the correct answer (e.g., \"The capital of France is Paris.\") and then maps the output back to the correct choice.\n",
        "     - **Logits Comparison**: For models that output probability distributions over tokens, you can compare the logits or probabilities of each choice and select the one with the highest score.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Evaluation Metrics\n",
        "   \n",
        "- **Accuracy**: The most straightforward metric, simply the ratio of correctly answered questions to the total number of questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$Accuracy = \\frac{\\text{Number of Correct Answers}}{\\text{Total Number of Questions}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Top-N Accuracy**: If evaluating with more complex answer spaces or ambiguous questions, you might use top-N accuracy, where the model is considered correct if the correct answer is within its top N predicted choices.\n",
        "- **Log-Loss**: In cases where the model provides probabilities for each answer, log-loss (cross-entropy) can be used to evaluate how confident the model is about its predictions.\n",
        "- **F1 Score**: If the questions involve multiple correct answers or require ranking, you can compute precision, recall, and the F1 score.\n",
        "\n",

        "The `target = \"llvm\"` setting in TVM refers to **LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine)** as the compilation target, which is used to generate optimized code for **CPU** inference. Here’s a detailed explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Use `llvm` as the Target?\n",
        "1. **General CPU Backend**:\n",
        "   - In TVM, `\"llvm\"` is used to represent a **general-purpose CPU backend**. By setting the target to `\"llvm\"`, TVM will generate machine code optimized for your CPU. LLVM is a popular compiler infrastructure that allows TVM to generate highly optimized native code for a wide variety of CPU architectures, including x86, ARM, etc.\n",
        "   - This is why `\"llvm\"` is commonly used when you want to run inference on a **CPU**, regardless of the specific type of CPU in your machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cross-Platform Compilation**:\n",
        "   - LLVM can be used to generate code for different types of CPUs, which makes it flexible and well-suited for **cross-compilation**. This means you can compile a model on one type of CPU and run it on another type.\n",
        "   - For example, you could use LLVM to compile on an x86 machine and then execute the code on an ARM-based CPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Optimized Performance**:\n",
        "   - LLVM enables various optimizations that are essential for deep learning workloads, such as **loop unrolling**, **vectorization**, and **instruction selection**. By using LLVM as the target, TVM can generate highly optimized machine-level code that takes advantage of CPU-specific features, such as vector instructions (e.g., AVX, NEON).\n",
        "   - This optimization process helps improve the performance of the inference on CPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Ease of Use**:\n",
        "   - The `\"llvm\"` target is the most straightforward target for many developers because it’s CPU-agnostic and doesn’t require specifying complex hardware details.\n",
        "   - It allows developers to use TVM without needing to worry about hardware-specific intricacies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Examples of TVM Targets\n",
        "Besides `\"llvm\"`, TVM supports various targets, each suited to different hardware:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **\"cuda\"**: Used for compiling models to run on **NVIDIA GPUs**. This enables the use of CUDA to leverage GPU acceleration.\n",
        "- **\"opencl\"**: Used for **OpenCL-compatible GPUs**, FPGAs, or other hardware accelerators.\n",
        "- **\"rocm\"**: Target for **AMD GPUs** that support ROCm.\n",
        "- **\"metal\"**: Target for running models on **macOS and iOS** devices using Apple's Metal API for GPU support.\n",
        "- **\"llvm -mtriple=aarch64-linux-gnu\"**: Can be used for **cross-compiling** to an ARM architecture CPU, typically for ARM-based devices such as embedded systems or mobile devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Use Cases\n",
        "- If you are deploying a model on a **desktop server or a cloud server** that uses CPUs, using `\"llvm\"` is appropriate.\n",
        "- For deploying a model on an **NVIDIA GPU**, you would use `\"cuda\"` as the target to ensure the generated code takes full advantage of GPU capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Back to the Code***\n",
        "\n",
